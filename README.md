# telecom-platform<br>
Various implementations of Spring controllers exposing RESTful API endoints and Spring Data fullfiled by Hibernate<br>

A front end is still under development<br>

You may test the API endpoints as they are live on Heroku (https://telecom-platform.herokuapp.com)<br>
credentials are static (username: admin , password: admin)<br>

refrain from running all the test packages simultaneously as that would push the app to use more than the maximum amount of connections allowed for the database

You may test the API endpoints via a Postman Collection as well on the following link<br>
