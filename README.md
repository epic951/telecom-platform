# telecom-platform<br>
Various implementations of Spring controllers exposing RESTful API endoints and Spring Data fullfiled by Hibernate<br>

Drived by Test-Driven Development through Unit testing and Integration testing for repositories,services and controllers

Upon visiting the app's link on Heroku  (https://telecom-platform.herokuapp.com) => Takes roughly a minute to go live ^^

you will be redirected to the Angular 4 frontend present in this GitHub repo 
(https://github.com/epic951/telecom-platform-frontend)
the credentials are static (username: admin , password: admin)<br>

Refrain from running all the test packages simultaneously as that would push the app to use more than the maximum amount of connections allowed for the database per Heroku

You may test the API endpoints via a Postman Collection as well on the following link<br>

or directly by pressing    [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/aaf8a8ed49564ad3634c)
